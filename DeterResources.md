# Software

* [Montage AGent Infrastructure](http://montage.deterlab.net/magi)
  * MAGI is a system for orchestrating networking experiments on the DETER testbed. MAGI enables deterministic orchestration of event streams, repeatable enactment of procedures, and control and data management for experiments
* [SEER Workbench](http://seer.deterlab.net)
  * DETER's Security Experimentation Environment (SEER) is a GUI-based user interface to DETERlab, helping an experimenter to set up, script, and perform experiments in the DETER environment.  The SEER back-end includes a set of tools and agents for traffic generation, attack generation, traffic collection, and data analysis.
* [Semantic Analysis Framework (SAF)](http://thirdeye.deterlab.net/)
   * !SAF is a framework for offline data analysis of networked and distributed system data. It enables users to analyse and reason over data using semantically meaningful abstractions and thus at a level closer to their understanding of system operation.
* [DETER Federation](http://fedd.deterlab.net/trac)
  * The DETER federation architecture is a model and mechanism for creating experiments that span multiple testbeds. We have written several papers about the architecture. This site is the home for our prototype implementation, fedd.
* [ABAC](http://abac.deterlab.net/)
  * ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) is a software library and suite of tools which act as a framework for doing distributed access control. It is used in the DETER federation architecture.
