# Capabilities for Experimentation

  * [Orchestration (MAGI)](/OrchestratorQuickstart) - Communications and control system for repeatable experimentation.
  * [Virtualization (Containers)](/ContainersQuickstart) - For creating large-scale  DETER topologies that support differing degrees of fidelity in individual elements. Helpful for experiments requiring 400+ computers. 
  * [Federation](http://fedd.deterlab.net/trac) - Federation architecture for creating experiments that span multiple testbeds through dynamically acquiring resources from other testbeds.
  * [Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)](http://abac.deterlab.net/) - Scalable authorization system used with the federation capability.
