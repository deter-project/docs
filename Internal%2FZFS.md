[AOC-USAS2-L8iR ](http://www.supermicro.com/products/accessories/addon/AOC-USAS2-L8i.cfm?TYP=I&RAID=Y) Came with RAID key.  Firmware downgraded to pure IT mode instead of iMR mode which uses the megaraid firmware enabled by a raid key.  Runs same firmware at 9200-8e slotted in the system.  Both controllers are SAS2008 based and are using the LSI P12 IT image.
