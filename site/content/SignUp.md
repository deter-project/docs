# Getting an Account

## Who may apply for a DETER project or request a user account?

Researchers from academia, government, and industry -- as well as educators from academic institutions -- may apply for a DeterLab project account. A student must have their professor or appropriate faculty member apply for an account, and once it is activated the student can then apply for membership to that project.

*Note*: For more information on using DeterLab for education, please refer to the  <a href="https://education.deterlab.net" target="_blank">DeterLab Education Site</a>.

## To Register
DETER accounts are grouped by projects, therefore the project leader or PI must first request a project, then other users apply for membership to that project.

*Note*: If you already have a DeterLab account, please login in first. This will help streamline the process.

### Requesting a New Project

* If you are a PI, project leader or instructor who wants to request a new project on DeterLab, fill out the [New Project Application Form](https://www.isi.deterlab.net/newproject.php).
     * You will be asked a number of questions about your project and how you intend to use DETER. Please be detailed, especially with respect to any possible risks from your experiment. A DETER staff member may contact you to discuss or clarify any potential issues.
     * The project leader is responsible for ensuring that the project adheres to the Project Plan included in the application form.
     * Instructors should indicate this project is for educational purposes. Once the project is created, you will receive further instructions including how to create accounts for your students.
* Upon submission, your application must be approved by the DETER Executive Committee; this generally takes a few days. They may contact you and ask for clarification. 
* You will receive an email notification upon approval and your user account will be active. You may log in with the username and password you entered on the form.
* If you are curious about the progress on your application, you may [contact us](http://www.deter-project.org/contact_deter).

### Getting a User Account to Join an Existing Project

* If you are a team member who needs to join an existing project, submit the [Apply for Project Membership Form](https://www.isi.deterlab.net/joinproject.php). 
* The project leader will be informed via email of your request and will be required to log in to approve your account.

## Note to Students

* If you are a student who wants to use DeterLab for your own research:
     * A faculty sponsor must first fill out the [New Project Application Form](https://www.isi.deterlab.net/newproject.php).
     * Once this has been done, the sponsor will instruct you to [apply for project membership](https://www.isi.deterlab.net/joinproject.php) which will create your DeterLab account. You must obtain the name of the DeterLab project from your sponsor to correctly fill out the form.
* If you are a student taking a class that uses DeterLab:
     * You do not need to take any action â€“ your instructor will create accounts and assign them to students.
