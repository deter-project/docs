== Rename a page #renaming

While picking up good WikiPageNames is important, you can always change your mind
and rename the page later.

You'll need to ask for the WIKI_RENAME permission in order to be allowed to do this.
When renaming a page, you'll be offered the possibility to create a redirection page, so that links pointing to the old location will not be left dangling.
