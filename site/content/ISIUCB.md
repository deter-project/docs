# The two DETER machine rooms

DETER has two machine rooms.  Nodes are split more or less evenly between the two machine rooms which are seamlessly bridged together over a gigabit link.

## ISI
The primary machine room is located in Southern California at [The University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute (ISI)](http://www.isi.edu).  This is where users.isi.deterlab.net and www.isi.deterlab.net are located.

## UCB
The other machine room is located in Northern California at [The University of California Berkeley (UCB)](http://www.berkeley.edu/).  Nodes that start with the letter 'b' are located at UCB.
