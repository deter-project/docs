# CentOS Images at DETER

## CentOS5

This is currently at CentOS 5.7.  We support CentOS instead of Fedora because of the longer term of support offered for CentOS.  The CentOS 5 image is a whole disk image with linux installed on partition 1.  This is different from the Emulab tradition of putting Linux on partition 2.

## CentOS6-64-STD

CentOS 6.
