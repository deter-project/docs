<p>The timeline provides a historic view of the project in a single report.</p>

<p>It lists all Trac events that have occurred in chronological order, a
brief description of each event and if applicable, the person responsible for
the change.</p>

<p>The timeline lists these kinds of events:
* <em>Wiki page events</em> — Creation and changes
* <em>Ticket events</em> — Creation and resolution/closing (and optionally other changes)
* *Source code changes * — Repository check-ins
* *Milestone * — Milestone completed</p>

<p>Each event entry provides a hyperlink to the specific event in question, who authored the change as well as
a brief excerpt of the actual comment or text, if available.</p>

<p>It is possible to filter the displayed events with the various filters in the option panel:
* <em>View changes from</em> — the date from which to start displaying events (current date if empty). Events that occurred after this date will not be shown, only those that occurred before that date.
* <em>and X days back</em> — how many days backwards in time to get events.
* <em>done by&rdquo; — the author of an event. It accepts a space-separated list of authors for which events should be included. Alternatively, if the author names are prefixed by a &ldquo;-&rdquo; character, then the events having those authors will be excluded, and all the others included. Single or double quotes can be used for specifying author names containing space characters. &ldquo;(since 0.12)</em>
* <em>Changesets in all repositories&rdquo; — if you have more than one repository connected to your Trac project, then you can filter the output so events from specific repositories are not shown. &ldquo;(since 0.12)</em>
* <em>Milestones reached</em> — display or hide milestones reached.
* <em>Opened and closed tickets</em> — display or hide ticket open or close events.
* <em>Wiki changes</em> — display or hide Wiki change events.</p>
