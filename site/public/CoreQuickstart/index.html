<p>This page describes basic information about DeterLab and its core functionality.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-deterlab:eac272858d0eda260fb9992444171bba">What is DeterLab?</h1>

<p>The DeterLab testbed is a security and education-enhanced version of <a href="https://www.emulab.net/">Emulab</a>. Funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Homeland Security, DeterLab is hosted by USC/ISI and UC Berkeley.</p>

<p>DeterLab (like Emulab) offers user accounts with assorted permissions associated with different experiment groups. Each group can have its own pre-configured experimental environments running on Linux, BSD, Windows, or other operating systems. Users running DeterLab experiments have full control of real hardware and networks running preconfigured software packages.</p>

<h1 id="how-does-it-work:eac272858d0eda260fb9992444171bba">How does it work?</h1>

<p>The software running DeterLab loads operating system images (low level disk copies) onto free nodes in the testbed, and then reconfigures programmable switches to create VLANs with the newly-imaged nodes connected according to the topology specified by the experiment creator.</p>

<p>After the system is fully imaged and configured, DeterLab executes specified scripts, unpacks tarballs, and/or installs RPM files according to the experiment&rsquo;s configuration. The end result is a live network of real machines, accessible via the Internet.</p>

<p>Work in DeterLab is based on <em>projects_&rsquo; that include individual &lsquo;_experiments</em> and is accomplished either via the browser-based web interface (isi.deterlab.net) or via commandline on the DeterLab nodes.</p>

<p>To access DeterLab, you need to create an account, which provides credentials for accessing both the web interface and nodes.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-get-a-deterlab-account:eac272858d0eda260fb9992444171bba">How do I get a DeterLab account?</h1>

<p>You may obtain a DeterLab account by either starting a new project (if you are a PI or instructor) or joining an existing project (if you are a project member or a student).</p>

<p><em>If you are the project investigator or instructor</em>, you must create a project and invite your team members or students to join.</p>

<p><em>If you are the member of a team using DeterLab</em>, your project leader will invite you to join the appropriate DeterLab project.</p>

<p><em>If you are a student</em>, you may not create a project. Your instructor must create the project and, once approved, will give you information for joining the project.</p>

<p>See [wiki:GettingStarted Getting Started] for more information.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-i-use-deterlab:eac272858d0eda260fb9992444171bba">How do I use DeterLab?</h1>

<p>In general, once you have a DeterLab account, you follow these steps. The [wiki:CoreGuide DeterLab Core Guide] will walk you through a basic tutorial of these steps.</p>

<h2 id="1-design-the-topology:eac272858d0eda260fb9992444171bba">1. Design the topology</h2>

<p>Every experiment in DeterLab is based on a network topology file written in NS format and saved on the users node. The following is a very basic example:</p>

<pre><code># This is a simple ns script. Comments start with #.
set ns [new Simulator]                 
source tb_compat.tcl

set nodeA [$ns node]
set nodeB [$ns node]
set nodeC [$ns node]
set nodeD [$ns node]

set link0 [$ns duplex-link $nodeB $nodeA 30Mb 50ms DropTail]
tb-set-link-loss $link0 0.01

set lan0 [$ns make-lan &quot;$nodeD $nodeC $nodeB &quot; 100Mb 0ms]

# Set the OS on a couple.
tb-set-node-os $nodeA FBSD7-STD
tb-set-node-os $nodeC Ubuntu1004-STD         

$ns rtproto Static

# Go!
$ns run                                 
</code></pre>

<h2 id="2-create-start-and-swap-in-allocate-resources-for-an-experiment:eac272858d0eda260fb9992444171bba">2. Create, start and swap in (allocate resources for) an experiment</h2>

<p>Using your topology file, you start a new experiment via menu options in the DeterLab web interface.</p>

<h2 id="3-generate-traffic-for-your-nodes:eac272858d0eda260fb9992444171bba">3. Generate traffic for your nodes</h2>

<p>Now you can experiment and start generating traffic for your nodes. We provide a [wiki:LegoTG flexible framework] to pull together the software you&rsquo;ll need.</p>

<h2 id="4-view-results-by-accessing-nodes-modify-the-experiment-as-needed:eac272858d0eda260fb9992444171bba">4. View results by accessing nodes, modify the experiment as needed.</h2>

<p>Once your experiment has started, you now can access nodes via SSH and conduct your desired experiments in your new environment.</p>

<p>You may modify aspects of a running experiment through the &ldquo;Modify experiment&rdquo; page in the web interface or by making changes to the NS file.</p>

<h2 id="5-save-your-work-and-swap-out-your-experiment-release-the-resources:eac272858d0eda260fb9992444171bba">5. Save your work and swap out your experiment (release the resources)</h2>

<p>When you are ready to stop working on an experiment but know you will want to work on it again, save your files in specific protected directories and swap-out (via web interface or commandline) to release resources back to the testbed. This helps ensure there are enough resources for all DeterLab users.</p>

<p>This is just a high-level overview. Go to the [wiki:CoreGuide Core Guide] for a basic hands-on example of using DeterLab Core.</p>
