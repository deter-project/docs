  <p>Existing wiki pages can be completely deleted using the <em>Delete Page&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Delete this Version</em> buttons at the bottom of the wiki page. These buttons are only visible for users with <code>WIKI_DELETE</code> permissions.
<em>Note:</em> Deleting a wiki page is an irreversible operation.</p>

<p>If you want to delete a page because you actually re-created a new page with the same content but a different name, it is recommended to keep the page and use it as a redirection page instead of completely deleting it, as to not frustrate the visitor with broken links when coming to the site from a search engine.</p>

<p>In this situation, chances are that you actually wanted to [[WikiNewPage#renaming|rename]] the page instead of doing a copy + delete.
The <em>Rename</em> operation also offers you the possibility to create a redirection page.
A redirection page is a short page that  contains a link such as  “See SomeOtherPage”.</p>

<p>However, deleting specific versions or even complete pages can make sense to remove spam or other abusive submissions.</p>
