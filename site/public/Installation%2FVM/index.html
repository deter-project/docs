<h1 id="networking:42768aca2137f2887c76670c8b21ef12">Networking</h1>

<p>Although you might be tempted to setup your network after importing the virtual machine templates, we <em>strongly</em> recommend having your networking in order before proceeding.  By having the network setup, the virtual machines will automatically associate the appropriate networks with their virtual interfaces.  Experience has shown that getting the network in order first will dramatically cut down on deployment time.</p>

<h1 id="server-templates:42768aca2137f2887c76670c8b21ef12">Server Templates</h1>

<p>There are three VMWare templates available at <a href="http://deterlab.net/~jjh/Deter%20VM%20Images/">http://deterlab.net/~jjh/Deter%20VM%20Images/</a> for Boss, Users, and Router nodes.  These images don&rsquo;t contain the DETER source, but do have all packages required package to build the testbed source.</p>

<p>Templates are easy to deploy on your local ESXi server.</p>

<p>In the &lsquo;vSphere Client&rsquo; Select &lsquo;File&rsquo;-&gt;&lsquo;Deploy OVF Template&rsquo; and put in the URL for the OVA template you are deploying:</p>

<p>The network mapping for your VM should map 1:1.  If it does not, <em>please make sure your networking is properly setup before proceeding</em>.  The previous section explains the network setup.</p>

<h1 id="a-note-about-virtual-machines-and-cpu-core-allocation:42768aca2137f2887c76670c8b21ef12">A note about Virtual Machines and CPU core allocation</h1>

<p>The boss and users templates come configured to use 2 CPUs.  This is problematic on VMWare servers with less than 2 CPUs, since you can only give a VM up to as many cores as the ESXi host has.  If you are installing onto an ESXi host that has fewer than 2 CPUs, you will have to edit the number of allocated cores in the VM settings for boss and users before being able to boot them.</p>

<h2 id="users-image-notes:42768aca2137f2887c76670c8b21ef12">Users Image Notes</h2>

<p>The users image contains two disk images.  One is for the main operating system and the other is for NFS exported filesystems.  These are kept separate in order to make it easy for sites to deploy a bigger NFS export filesystem.  You may want to replace the second image with a larger image.  Here are the steps used to setup the original /big disk (which is 80GB).  Make sure to pay attention to the device you are setting up.  If you are adding a third disk to replace the existing big, you will probably be dealing with &lsquo;da2&rsquo;:</p>

<p>The users image is also configured with &lsquo;tinyproxy&rsquo; which will allow isolated testbed nodes to fetch packages via HTTP.  The configuration is /usr/local/etc/tinyproxy.conf.   The proxy should be configured to only listen to requests coming from the control network.</p>

<p>Nothing special to note yet.</p>

<h2 id="router-image-notes:42768aca2137f2887c76670c8b21ef12">Router Image Notes</h2>

<p>This image is minimally configured to route between the various networks.  It is also configured to route/relay Multicast and DHCP requests between boss and the control network.</p>
