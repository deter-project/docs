<p>Trac has a built-in wiki engine, used for text and documentation throughout the system. WikiFormatting is used in [wiki:TitleIndex wiki pages], [wiki:TracTickets tickets], [wiki:TracChangeset check-in log messages], [wiki:TracRoadmap milestone] and [wiki:TracReports report] descriptions.  It allows for formatted text and hyperlinks in and between all Trac modules.</p>

<p>Editing wiki text is easy, using any web browser and a simple [WikiFormatting formatting system], rather than more complex markup languages like HTML.  The reasoning behind its design is that HTML, with its large collection of nestable tags, is too complicated to allow fast-paced editing, and distracts from the actual content of the pages. Note though that Trac also supports [WikiHtml HTML], [WikiRestructuredText reStructuredText] and <a href="http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a> as alternative markup formats.</p>

<p>The main goal of the wiki is to make editing text easier and <em>encourage</em> people to contribute and annotate text content for a project. Trac also provides a simple toolbar to make formatting text even easier, and supports the <a href="http://universaleditbutton.org/Universal_Edit_Button">universal edit button</a> of your browser.</p>

<p>The wiki itself does not enforce any structure, but rather resembles a stack of empty sheets of paper, where you can organize information and documentation as you see fit, and later reorganize if necessary.
As contributing to a wiki is essentially building an hypertext,
general advice regarding HTML authoring apply here as well.
For example, the <em><a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style">Style Guide for online hypertext</a></em> explains how to think about the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/Structure.html">overall structure of a work</a>
and how to organize information <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/WithinDocument.html">within each document</a>. One of the most important tip is “make your HTML page such that you can read it even if you don&rsquo;t follow any links.”</p>

* WikiNewPage creation, which can be configured to start from a [PageTemplates page template]
* WikiFormatting rules, including advanced topics like WikiMacros and WikiProcessors
* How to use WikiPageNames and other forms of TracLinks which are used to refer in a precise way to any resource within Trac</p>

<p>If you want to practice editing, please use the SandBox.</p>

<p>Before saving your changes, you can <em>Preview&rdquo; the page or &ldquo;Review the Changes</em> you&rsquo;ve made.
You can get an automatic preview of the formatting as you type when you activate the <em>Edit Side-by-side&rdquo; mode. &ldquo; There is a [wiki:/TracIni#trac-section configurable delay] between when you make your edit and when the automatic preview will update.</em></p>
