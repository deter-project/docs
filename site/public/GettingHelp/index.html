<p><em>The short answer:</em>  take <em>all</em> of the details about your problem (project/experiment id, logs, error output, etc) and <a href="https://trac.deterlab.net/newticket">file a ticket</a> - you must log in again with your DeterLab username and password.</p>

<p>Read the [wiki:FrequentlyAskedQuestions FAQ page] to see if your question has already been answered. You can also search the documentation and trouble tickets on the [/search Search] page.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-collect-the-information-we-need-to-help-you:f0a16b1707a7affbabb7270e60abbce1">Step 1: Collect the information we need to help you</h2>

<p>Take a few moments to properly document what you are having trouble with to get your problem addressed quickly. Please include the following information in your ticket:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your DeterLab username</li>
<li>Your project name</li>
<li>Your experiment (if applicable)

<ul>
<li>Include a link in this format: <code>[experiment:pid:eid]</code> where <code>pid</code> is the project name and <code>eid</code> is the experiment name.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A description of the problem.  Be as detailed as you can.  The following are all helpful:

<ul>
<li>What you typed or clicked, what you expected to happen as a result, and what did happen</li>
<li>Any error messages or logs (verbatim errors are best)</li>
<li>Which nodes in your experiment are having a problem (if applicable)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If your problem is with an experiment, please leave a copy swapped in for us (disable idle swap)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-2-create-a-new-support-ticket:f0a16b1707a7affbabb7270e60abbce1">Step 2: Create a new support ticket</h2>

<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://trac.deterlab.net/newticket">the new ticket page</a> and log in again with your DeterLab username and password. Note: you will receive an <em><em>Error:Forbidden</em></em> when you first click the link - this is expected (the ticket system currently requires a separate login).</li>
<li>Fill in as many details as possible (see above)

<ul>
<li><em>Summary</em>: Use a brief description of the issue</li>
<li><em>Reporter</em>: User your DeterLab username (this should be pre-filled)</li>
<li><em>Message</em>: Include the project name and all of the other details you collected in the first step.</li>
<li><em>Attachments</em>: You may include screenshots and any other files (logs, etc) that could be useful to us in understanding your issue.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>We are notified when new tickets are opened and respond to them quickly, often as soon as we receive them (during business hours, US Pacific time).</p>

<p>You can use the <em>View Tickets</em> button in the navigation bar to find any tickets you have created.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are reporting a support problem, <em>do not email us</em>. Instead, follow the instructions above for filing a support ticket.</li>
<li>If for some reason you must email us, DeterLab testbed operations may be reached at testbed-ops at deterlab.net.</li>
<li>Response to this email is typically slower than response to a ticket.</li>
<li>Always send email to the testbed-ops address and not just an individual who responded to you. Then, if the individual is not available, someone will still be aware of your email.</li>
</ul>
