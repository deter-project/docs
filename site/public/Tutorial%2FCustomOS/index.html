<p>In order to make the best use of custom operating system images, it is important to understand the difference between these two concepts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An image id is a descriptor for a disk image.  This can be an image of an entire disk, a partition of a disk, or a set of partitions of a disk.  By supporting multiple partitions, we can technically support different operating systems within the same disk image.  These are referred to as combo images.  The image id points to real file that is stored in directory /proj/{YourProject}/images.  Associated with the image id is other critical information such as what node types are supported by the images and what operating systems are on each partition.  You can view the image ids on the <a href="https://www.isi.deterlab.net/showimageid_list.php3">List ImageIDs page</a> which is in the Experimentation drop down menu on the testbed web interface.</p></li>

<li><p>An OSID describes an operating system which resides on a partition of a disk image.  Every ImageID will have at least one OSID associated with it.  In typical testbed use, the ImageID and OSID will be the same, since we usually do not put multiple operating systems on a single image.  You can view the operating system ids on the <a href="https://www.isi.deterlab.net/showosid_list.php3">List OSIDs page</a> which is in the Experimentation drop down menu on the testbed web interface.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We provide a number of supported testbed images here at DETER.  These images can be viewed by looking at the <a href="https://www.isi.deterlab.net/showosid_list.php3">Operating System ID list</a>.  Most new operating system images that we support are whole disk images, which is different from traditional Emulab scheme of using partition 1 for FreeBSD and partition 2 for Linux.  To view what nodes a particular operating system image runs on and what sort of
partition scheme it uses, please refer to the <a href="https://www.isi.deterlab.net/showimageid_list.php3">Image ID list page</a>.</p>

<p>The supported testbed images are listed in the [wiki:OSImages Operating System Images] wiki page.</p>

<p>#CustomOS</p>

<p>If your set of operating system customizations cannot be easily contained within an RPM/TAR (or multiple RPM/TARs), then you can create your own custom OS image; Emulab allows you to create your own disk images and load them on your experimental nodes, automatically when your experiment is created or swapped in. Once you have created a custom disk image (and the associated <a href="https://www.isi.deterlab.net/newimageid_ez.php3"> image/osid descriptor</a> for it, you can use that OSID in your NS file. When your experiment is swapped in, the testbed system will arrange for your disks to be loaded in parallel using a locally written multicast disk loading protocol. Experience has shown that it is much faster to load a disk image on 10 nodes at once, then it is to load a bunch of RPMS or tarballs on each node as it boots. So, while it may seem like overkill to create your own disk image, we can assure you it is not!</p>

<p>The most common approach is to use the <a href="https://www.isi.deterlab.net/newimageid_ez.php3">New Image Descriptor</a> form to create a disk image that contains a customized version of a standard Linux or the FreeBSD image. All you need to do is enter the node name in the form, and the testbed system will create the image for you automatically, notifying you via email when it is finished. You can then use that image in subsequent experiments by specifying the descriptor name in your NS file with the [wiki:nscommands#tb-set-node-os <code>tb-set-node-os</code>] directive. When the experiment is configured, the proper image will be loaded on each node automatically by the Emulab system.</p>

<h1 id="creating-your-custom-image:f5c372c479a5d34d245df77db002935c">Creating your Custom Image</h1>

<p>A typical approach to creating your own disk image using one of the default images as a base, goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>1. Create a single-node Linux or FreeBSD experiment. In your NS file, use the appropriate `tb-set-node-os` directive. For example, one of the following statements:

    tb-set-node-os $nodeA FBSD7-STD
    tb-set-node-os $nodeA Ubuntu1004-STD

1. After your experiment has swapped in (you have received the email saying it is running), log into the node and load all of the software packages that you wish to load (if you want to install the latest version of the Linux kernel on one of our standard disk images, or on your own custom Linux image. Be sure to arrange for any programs that need to be started at boot time. It is a good idea to reboot the node and make sure that everything is running as you want it to when it comes up.
1. If you are creating a _Windows_ based image, you *must* &quot;prepare&quot; the node. The final thing to do before grabbing the image is to login on the [wiki:Tutorial/UsingNodes#SerialConsole console], drop to single user mode, and run the `prepare` script. This is described in detail in the [wiki:Windows#Custom_images custom Windows images] section of the Windows tutorial.
1. Note the physical (pcXXX) name of the machine used!
1. Create an image descriptor and image using the [New Image Descriptor](https://www.isi.deterlab.net/newimageid_ez.php3) form.
1. Wait for the email saying the image creation is done.
1. Now you can create a second single-node experiment to test your new image. In your .ns file, use `tb-set-node-os` to select the OSID that you just created. Be sure to remove any RPM or tarball directives. Submit that NS file and wait for the email notification. Then log into the new node and check to make sure everything is running normally.
1. If everything is going well, terminate both of these single-node experiments. If not, release the experiment created in the previous step, and then go back and fix the original node (pcXXX above). Recreate the image as needed:

    create_image -p &lt;proj&gt; &lt;imageid&gt; &lt;node&gt;

1. Once your image is working properly, you can use it in any NS file by using the `tb-set-node-os`.
</code></pre>

<p>If you ever want to reload a node in your experiment, either with one of your images or with one of the default images, you can use the <code>os_load</code> command. Log into <code>users</code> and run:</p>

<pre><code>    os_load -p &lt;proj&gt; -i &lt;imageid&gt; &lt;node&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This program will run in the foreground, waiting until the image has been loaded. At that point you should log in and make sure everything is working okay. You might want to watch the console line as well (see the [wiki:Tutorial/UsingNodes#SerialConsole Node Console section]). If you want to load the default image, then simply run:</p>

<pre><code>    os_load &lt;node&gt;
</code></pre>

<h1 id="updating-your-custom-image:f5c372c479a5d34d245df77db002935c">Updating your Custom Image</h1>

<p>Once you have your image, it is easy to update it later by taking a
new snapshot from a node running your image. Assuming you have swapped
in an experiment with a node running your image, and you have made
changes to that node, use the DETER web interface to navigate to the
descriptor page for your image:</p>

<pre><code>1. Use the &quot;Experimentation&quot; drop down menu, and choose &quot;List
   Imageids&quot; to see the entire list of Images to which you have
   access to.
1. Find your custom image and click on it.
1. In the &quot;More Options&quot; menu, click on &quot;Snapshot Node ...&quot;
1. Fill in the name of the node that is running your image, and
   click on &quot;Go&quot;
1. As in the above instructions, wait for the email saying your
   image has been updated before you try and use the image.
