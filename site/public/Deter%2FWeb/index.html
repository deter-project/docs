<h2 id="the-very-first-page-anyone-sees-www-deterlab-net:069897309e46ee615bb44bb93a8e13ba">The very first page ANYONE sees (www.deterlab.net)</h2>

<p>[[Image(frontpage.jpg)]]</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Project information&rdquo; needs to be renamed. The target of this link is redone isi.edu/deter content that speaks both about what we do and what people do on DETER</li>

<li><p>Somewhere on the target page for the above comment should be a list of projects where clicking on each name (or maybe beside the name) one gets a description of the project that people filled in their project application. There should also be some way for a user to contact a PI on any project</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.isi.edu/deter/publications.php">Publications Made Possible By DETER</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="contact-us-info:069897309e46ee615bb44bb93a8e13ba">Contact us info</h2>

<ul>
<li>We should have multiple contact people there depending on a reason (help, PR, &hellip;)</li>
<li>We should adjust our FAQ so that if you can&rsquo;t log in you are not asked to send us a ticket (for which you must be logged in to do) but email us instead</li>
<li>Contact info should be more prominently displayed on each page, logged in or not</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="open-an-account-page:069897309e46ee615bb44bb93a8e13ba">Open an account page</h2>

<ul>
<li>Takes people to open acct and create/join project dialogue</li>
<li>No other info is there</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="once-logged-in-to-deter:069897309e46ee615bb44bb93a8e13ba">Once Logged in to DETER</h2>

<p>Once logged in they see these new links/one-item menus on top of their screen - clicking on those leads them to an environment customized for a given purpose
  * Experiment
  * Collaborate
  * Teach
  * Learn</p>

<p>There is a floating menu or something for &ldquo;Information&rdquo; that appears in each of these environments. It should be accessible somewhere even if one is not logged in. It contains:</p>

<pre><code>  * Beginner's manual [Deter/Web/Beginners]
  * Complete manual (pretty much Emulab's stuff = beginner + advanced)
  * FAQ
  * Reference material
  * Build your DETER
     * This page has info how to build your own DETER, with pointers to Emulab stuff
  * Statistics (perhaps we don't need this menu item)
     * Any stats we want to display publicly such as usage, projects on DETER, project categories, user map
</code></pre>

<p>There are also news that appear prominently on each page. They fall into three categories: operational (testbed down..), conferences/research opportunities and new DETER features. We are not sure what&rsquo;s the right mechanism to make sure these are seen by most users.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-environment:069897309e46ee615bb44bb93a8e13ba">Experiment environment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Begin an experiment (MENU ITEM)

<ul>
<li>This page has links to begin a regular or risky experiment. Ideally it&rsquo;s one form with an option to make experiment risky. It also should have options to federate or to use SEER, transparently, hopefully as checkboxes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create/join project (MENU ITEM)

<ul>
<li>Same as now but ideally blends create/join options into one page</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tools (DISPLAYED SOMEWHERE ON THE PAGE ALWAYS)

<ul>
<li>This page takes users to an &ldquo;exchange&rdquo; place where they can submit their tools or look for tools submitted by others including us.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Node status (DISPLAYED SOMEWHERE ON THE PAGE ALWAYS)

<ul>
<li>Same as now, shows which nodes are taken/free</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Image/OS list (DISPLAYED SOMEWHERE ON THE PAGE ALWAYS)</p>

<ul>
<li>Same as now but I&rsquo;m fairly sure that we could blend image and OS data into one. After all users seem to need just one</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>We should order tasks on Experimentation menu to fit user&rsquo;s path to experiment creation</p></li>

<li><p>Starting experiments that other users made public should be possible from this page</p></li>

<li><p>This page is mostly about experimenter&rsquo;s path to the experiment</p></li>

<li><p>Main part of experimentation page should be what is now on &ldquo;My Deterlab&rdquo;. Clicking on an experiment from &ldquo;My Deterlab&rdquo; should then lead one to a page where experiment lifecycle is supported</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="teaching-environment:069897309e46ee615bb44bb93a8e13ba">Teaching environment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Chat</li>
<li>Discussion list</li>
<li>Any other social networking we come up with</li>
<li>Perhaps tool sharing should be available from this page too</li>
<li>Should have info about what people are doing on DETER (Project info, contacts)</li>
<li>One should be able to chat with current users that are doing something of interest to that person - this should be effortless</li>
<li>There are multiple collaboration modes:

<ul>
<li>collaborate with other users (either on DETER or apart from DETER or even find experts in your area that are not DETER users)</li>
<li>collaborate with us if we&rsquo;re doing research related to you</li>
<li>request new features from DETER</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="learning-environment:069897309e46ee615bb44bb93a8e13ba">Learning environment</h3>

<ul>

</ul>
