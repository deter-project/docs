<p>Researchers from academia, government, and industry &ndash; as well as educators from academic institutions &ndash; may apply for a DeterLab project account. A student must have their professor or appropriate faculty member apply for an account, and once it is activated the student can then apply for membership to that project.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: For more information on using DeterLab for education, please refer to the  <a href="https://education.deterlab.net/">DeterLab Education Site</a>.</p>

<h1 id="to-register:4d68265eddb12acdb909f802d5a1464c">To Register</h1>

<p>DETER accounts are grouped by projects, therefore the project leader or PI must first request a project, then other users apply for membership to that project.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: If you already have a DeterLab account, please login in first. This will help streamline the process.</p>
