  <p>Like in most <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source projects</a>, &ldquo;free&rdquo; Trac support is available primarily through the community itself, mainly through the [trac:MailingList mailing list] and the [trac: project wiki].</p>

<p>There is also an [trac:IrcChannel IRC channel], where people might be able to help out. Much of the &lsquo;live&rsquo; development discussions also happen there.</p>

<p>Before you start a new support query, make sure you&rsquo;ve done the appropriate searching:
* in the project&rsquo;s [trac:TracFaq FAQ]
* in past messages to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/trac-users">Trac Users Mailing List</a>
* in the Trac ticket system, using either a [trac:search:?q=&amp;ticket=on&amp;wiki=on full search] or a [trac:query: ticket query].</p>

<p>Please <em>don&rsquo;t</em> create a ticket in trac.egdewall.org for asking a support question about Trac. Only use it when you face a <em>real&rdquo; and &ldquo;new</em> bug in Trac, and do so only after having read the [trac:NewTicketGuidelines NewTicketGuidelines]. The more a bug report or enhancement request complies with those guidelines, the higher the chances are that it will be fixed or implemented promptly!</p>
