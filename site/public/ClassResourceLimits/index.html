<h1 id="what-are-resource-limits:7bb2e621c260edd8b7b8790aa22b02e6">What are resource limits?</h1>

<p>If you are a class user, your class only have access to a limited number of nodes. You can see how many nodes are available for your class on your My DETERlab page.</p>

<h1 id="what-error-message-will-i-receive-if-there-are-no-nodes-left-for-my-project:7bb2e621c260edd8b7b8790aa22b02e6">What error message will I receive if there are no nodes left for my project?</h1>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Admission Control: $project/$experiment has too many nodes allocated!
</code></pre>

<h1 id="maximum-node-usage:7bb2e621c260edd8b7b8790aa22b02e6">Maximum Node Usage</h1>

<p>Each class is limited to a portion of its max required nodes for the duration of an assignment. This portion should be around <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> for large classes and around <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> for small ones. Instructors are asked to set this limit by clicking on the &ldquo;Teaching&rdquo; tab of their &ldquo;My DETERlab&rdquo; page, and then clicking in the &ldquo;Input Schedule&rdquo; box under &ldquo;Class Projects&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Collectively all classes will be limited to <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the maximum capacity of the testbed at all times (which is to say: 330 nodes).</p>

<h1 id="rationale:7bb2e621c260edd8b7b8790aa22b02e6">Rationale</h1>

<p>DETERlab has 500 nodes (physical PCs) split between ISI in Marina del Rey and UC Berkeley. They are our most scarce resource.</p>

<p>In order to provide fair access to nodes to all users of the testbed (researchers and classes alike), we impose limits on the maximum number of nodes available to classes.</p>
