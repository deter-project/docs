<p>This section of the tutorial describes how to run your first DETER
experiment. We cover basic NS (Network Simulation) syntax and various operational issues
that you will need to know in order to conduct experiments to
completion. Later sections of the tutorial will cover more advanced
topics such as loading your own RPMs automatically, running programs
automatically, creating your own disk images and
loading those images on your nodes. For your convenience, there is
also a Java GUI interface
you can use to generate NS files for your experiments.
Before you begin using the Java GUI, make sure your JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is up to date,
Java applets are enabled in your browser
and the required security exception has been added to your Java site list.
For instructions on how to do this, please read our [wiki:Tutorial/GettingTheJavaGUIToWork Getting The Java GUI To Work] tutorial.
Once you are ready to use the Java GUI, you can find it here: <a href="https://www.isi.deterlab.net/clientui.php3">Java GUI</a>.</p>

<p>If you already have an account on DETER, all you need to do
is go to <a href="https://www.isi.deterlab.net">DETER Home Page</a>, enter your login
name and your password, and then click on the &ldquo;Login&rdquo; button. If you
don&rsquo;t have an account, click on the &ldquo;Join Project&rdquo; or &ldquo;Start Project&rdquo;
