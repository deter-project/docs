<p>DETERLab is regarded as a scientific instrument to
create knowledge and understanding through
observation and measurement of cyber security
technologies. DETERLab provides a
flexible software framework to
structure the experiment environment
and execute the procedue
while ensuring experiment validity and repeatability.
In this section we discuss each of these aspects in
detail.</p>

<h1 id="environment:c2a451dd5f47998c7db14d0cce223a8c">Environment</h1>

<p>The experiment environment defines the set of
resources required to configure a DETERLab experiment.
It consists of the three planes and
elements with different functional behaviors mapped onto them.
We discuss each in detail below.</p>

<p>The experiment environment consists of three planes:</p>

<ul>
<li>*an experiment plane: *</li>
</ul>

<p>The plane that carries the experiment traffic.
  It consists of the set of experiment nodes, substrates,
  and their topological structure.
  The functional behaviors are
  mapped onto the experiment nodes.
  For example, an experiment may consist of background
  traffic generators including webserver and webclients,
  attack traffic generators, including botmasters and bots.
  The structure is defined in the TopDL/ns-2
  description file.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>*a control plane: *
The plane to send and receive  control specific instructions and
signalling commands to the experiment nodes.
In addition to the experiment nodes, other control-specific
nodes such as an orchestrator and a bridge may also belong to the control<br />
plane.
The topological structure of the control plane
is defined by the testbed or configured per experiment
in the TopDL/MesDL description file.
The topology consists of four types of elements.
Namely, directors, bridges, overlays, and orchestrators.</p></li>

<li><p>*a data plane: *
The plane to carry measurement specific traffic for
for analysis and visualization.
In addition to the experiment nodes, other data specific
nodes, such as aggregators and collectors,
may also belong to the data plane.
The topological structure of the data plane
is defined by the testbed or configured per experiment
in the description TopDL/MesDL file.<br />
The topology consists of four types of elements,
namely, sensors, collector, aggregators and queriers.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are five types of properties that can be configured for
each experiment element:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>process</em>:
The property characterizes the <em>computational capacity</em>
of the element.
A functional mapping of the behavior onto the element can impose
requirement constraints, that is, a webserver requires at least 200Mhz
of computational capacity.
Computational capacity units can be specified in jiffies and clock speed.</p></li>

<li><ul>
<li>storage*:
This property characterizes the local <em>persistent</em> (and non&ndash;persistent)
recording capacity of the element.
A functional mapping of the behavior onto the element can impose
different storage requirement constraints. For example, a router
element in the experiment may not require any storage, whereas, a
collector element may require a lot of storage capacity.<br /></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><em>network interface</em>:
This property characterizes the cardinality and type of network interface
on the experiment element. There may be more than one interface.
Each interface has its own rate and delay characteristics.
The functional mappings of the behavior onto the element can impose
different interface requirements. For example, collectors may require
a high bandwidth interface, core routers in an experiment topology
may require many interfaces.</p></li>

<li><p><em>sense</em>:
 This property characterizes the types of stimulus the element can sense.
 For example, heat, GPS signal, high rate packet capture, video.</p></li>

<li><p><em>actuate</em>:
 This property characterizes the types of responses the element can implement.
 For example, bring down an interface, increase delay on a link,
 partition a network</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Each experiment element has incoming and outgoing connections to one or more
experiment planes.</p>

<pre><code>#!comment
Each experiment element has incoming and outgoing connections:
Based on the type of element, it will have one or more 
communicate, sense and actuate functions. 

Incoming: 
From experiment plane: the experiment  traffic (router/server)
From control plane: the control management traffic (event signals, actuation signals)
From data plane: data management traffic 
(collection traffic into a collector, data streams into a aggregator)


Outgoing: 
To experiment plane: the experiment traffic (router/traffic generator)
To control plane: return triggers from nodes, actuation signals from evaluators 
To data plane: sensing data from sensor, aggregation from aggregator
</code></pre>

<h1 id="workflow:c2a451dd5f47998c7db14d0cce223a8c">Workflow</h1>

<p>The experiment workflow defines the dynamic
procedure enacted to conduct a DETERLab experiment.
It consists of three main activities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>*Event Streams: *
An event is a  signal to invoke a particular behavior on the experiment nodes.
The event streams in an experiment are
partially ordered set of events defined as a directed acyclic graph.
An experiment workflow consists on one or more event streams<br />
defined in an AAL  description file.
All event signals are sent over the control plane
typically by the orchestrator.</p></li>

<li><p>*Triggers: *
A synchronization point in the dynamic experiment workflow.
The trigger may be <em>time-based</em>, that is the orchestrator waits for
a particular amount of time to lapse or <em>event-based</em>, where the
orchestrator waits to receive a signal before proceeding with the
workflow. Triggers can be used to synchronize one or more event streams.
All triggers are sent over the control plane.
Triggers are defined as part of the experiment workflow in
the AAL description file.</p></li>

<li><p>*Collectors: *
A signal to enable sensing and collection of experiment measurements for
feedback as
triggers and for analysis.
All sensing and collection measurements are sent over the data plane.
Collectors may be defined within the procedure description AAL file.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="validity-management:c2a451dd5f47998c7db14d0cce223a8c">Validity Management</h1>

<p>The experiment validity is maintained by a set of constraints and
invariants asserted throughout the experiment lifecycle.
They relate to the experiment environment and the workflow as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Environment:</em>
 During the process of defining and configuring the environment,
 the constraints and invariants can be used to
 ensure the validity of a particular configuration step.
 Some constraints and invariants may indicate key
 capacity requirements for validity,
 for example, CPU requirements for experiment nodes,
 while some may be functional requirements, such as,
 number of available client hosts.
 The constraints and invariants are defined in an ECL description file
 and processed by the DETERLab validity management framework.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Workflow:</em>
During experiment execution, the constraints and invariants
can be used to ensure that the experiment proceeds in accordance
with these assumptions. The constraints can thus be used to ensure
<em>safety</em>, that is, the experiment will not do anything bad and
<em>liveness</em> that is, the experiment will do something useful.<br />
The constraints and invariants are defined in an ECL description file
and processed by the DETERLab validity management framework.</p></li>
</ul>
