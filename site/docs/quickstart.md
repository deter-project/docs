# Quickstart

This page describes basic information about DETERLab and its core functionality. Please make sure to read detailed information about each step by clicking on the links in the menu or on the shapes in the figure.


## What is DETERLab?

The DETERLab testbed is a testbed for cybersecurity experimentation. It is an open public testbed and it is free for research and educational use, as well as for commercial product development and testing.

DETERLab users gain superuser access to physical or virtual machines, and can install and run applications of their choice. Connections between machines (topology and routes) can also be configured by the user to meet their research needs.

DETERLab is similar to a cloud, in a sense that one can allocate multiple nodes for an experiment. However, in a cloud users often receive *virtual machines*, and set them up with *similar configurations* to perform *computation tasks*. In DETERLab, users request *physical machines*, and also specify *their connections*. Users often set up these machines with *different configurations*, and use them to perform *system and network tasks*, and to *generate traffic*.
