# What is ABAC?

The ABAC project has designed and implemented tools for using Attribute-Based Access Control, a scalable authorization system based on formal logic. It maps principals to attributes and uses the attribute to make an authorization decision, e.g., if user1 has the login attribute the login program will allow them to log in. This library, libabac, is a base on which to build those tools. It is in use in the <a href="http://fedd.deterlab.net/">DETER Federation system</a> and being integrated with the  <a href="http://geni.net/">GENI network testbed</a>.
