If you are teaching a class with DETERLab, we will automatically subscribe you to our **education mailing list**. You may also ask to be subscribed.

This list is for teachers and TAs only. Teachers must request that their TAs get subscribed.

You can use this list to discuss issues related to your class and DETERLab. We use this list to facilitate scheduling and resolve conflicts between assignment deadlines and to plan resource usage.
