# Submitting Your Work

A student can submit their work by doing the following:

1. Click on *My Classes* tab in *My Deterlab* view
2. Click on *Choose file* button next to your assignment then click on *Submit* button

You can resubmit your work as many times as you like. Your later submissions overwrite the previous ones.

Currently, there is no indication that the system shows to the student for a successful submission. Your instructor or TA can check if the system has noted your submission.
