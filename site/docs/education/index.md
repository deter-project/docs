!!! note
    Students will access education materials (e.g., homework assignments) on our <a href="https://isi.deterlab.net">old platform</a> but complete their assignments on <a href="https://launch.mod.deterlab.net/">our new platform</a>. Their usernames and passwords are the same on both platforms.
