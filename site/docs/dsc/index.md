# Network Emulation Using GraphGen

Sometimes researchers need to emulate very large and complex topologies
connecting enclaves of nodes. The core of such topology may contain hundreds
of nodes and it may be impractical to emulate it using physical machines.
This guide shows how to replace the core of such topology with a single
Click router, which faithfully emulates bandwidth and delay on inter-router
links.
