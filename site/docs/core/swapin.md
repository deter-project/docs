# Start An Experiment (Swap-in)

To start an experiment you will need to ``swap it in'', which will allocate resources to it.

1. Go to your dashboard by clicking the *My DETERLab* link on the top menu.
2. In the *Current Experiments* table, click on the name of the experiment you want to start. In our example this will be `basic-experiment`
3. If needed, modify default options for when the experiment should be swapped out. You can do so by clicking on *Modify Settings* on the left sidebar.
3. On the left sidebar, click *Swap Experiment In*, then click *Confirm*. 

Usually the swap in process will take several minutes, depending on the size of your toology. You will receive an email notification when it is complete. While you are waiting, you can watch the swap in process displayed in your web browser.

In some cases there may be errors during swap in, either because you have errors in your topology specification or because you have asked for resources the testbed does not currently have. The email message you receive will help you understand why the error occured.
