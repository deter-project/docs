# What is Federation?

The DETER federation architecture is a model and mechanism for creating experiments that span multiple testbeds. We have written <a href="http://fedd.deterlab.net/wiki/FeddPubs">several papers</a> about the architecture. This site is the home for our implementation, fedd. 

For more information, go to the Federation site.
