DETERLab has two machine rooms.  Nodes are split more or less evenly between the two, which are seamlessly bridged together over a Gigabit link.

## ISI
The primary machine room is located in Southern California at <a href="http://www.isi.edu">The University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute (ISI)</a>.  This is where `users.isi.deterlab.net` and `www.isi.deterlab.net` are located.

## UCB
The other machine room is located in Northern California at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">The University of California Berkeley (UCB)</a>.  Nodes that start with the letter **b** are located at UCB.
