Like in most [open source projects](http://www.opensource.org/), "free" Trac support is available primarily through the community itself, mainly through the [trac:MailingList mailing list] and the [trac: project wiki].

There is also an [trac:IrcChannel IRC channel], where people might be able to help out. Much of the 'live' development discussions also happen there.

Before you start a new support query, make sure you've done the appropriate searching:
* in the project's [trac:TracFaq FAQ]
* in past messages to the [Trac Users Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/trac-users)
* in the Trac ticket system, using either a [trac:search:?q=&ticket=on&wiki=on full search] or a [trac:query: ticket query].

Please *don't* create a ticket in trac.egdewall.org for asking a support question about Trac. Only use it when you face a _real'' and ''new_ bug in Trac, and do so only after having read the [trac:NewTicketGuidelines NewTicketGuidelines]. The more a bug report or enhancement request complies with those guidelines, the higher the chances are that it will be fixed or implemented promptly!
