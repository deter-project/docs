# Running the malware

## Infrastructure security

Revisit the firewall rules on router to prevent leakage channels. Absolute minimum set of services should be allowed from testbed -> users/boss/etc.

## Isolation from other experiments

Control net separation

# Storage and Leakage

Primary goals are to allow vetted users to access the malware safely and prevent unauthorized users from gaining access.

## Leakage of binaries

Some belt-and-suspenders support to prevent leakage is to export NFS shares read-only:

* /proj, /groups, /share, etc.
* home directories

## Storage

The archive is 60 GB (in two 30 GB archives). We will receive approximately 1 GB per day in updates. In light of the size, we will store it on scratch.

It will be exported using SMB in a password-protected share.

# Policy Issues

* Do not copy it off experiment
* Do not attempt to run on non-malware experiment

# Miscellaneous

Updates occur over SSH. We need to provide GA tech with a key.

How will we annotate the experiment file to let the testbed know this needs special treatment (i.e., read-only mounts, copy encryption key/token to box)?
